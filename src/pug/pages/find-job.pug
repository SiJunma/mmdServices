      p Finding the right person to fill your IT position can be hard work.

      p Hours spent reviewing junky resumes, interviews with disappointing candidates, and explaining position requirements again and again.  In some cases the hiring process takes so looong that IT managers settle for second best.  Rather than hiring the perfect candidate, they hire someone who is “good enough”.
      p At MMD we don’t believe in “good enough”.  We work with companies all over the Chicago area to make hiring top talent easy.  By leveraging our massive candidate database and network of contacts, we locate the passive job seekers, the A-list talent that you’re not going to find on Dice or Monster.
